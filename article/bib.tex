\section{Introduction}

During our work, we have implemented and reviewed Structured classifier for different tasks including : Multi-class classification, hierarchical classification and ranking. As we would see, Structured models provide the ability to train a single model rather than training multiple binary classifiers.
The idea is to fit use the dual problem to fit a single classifier using multiple optimization problem of reduced size rather than several binary classifiers.

\section{MultiClass Kernel-based Vector Machines}

Several ways have been used to 
However, such models doesn't have the ability to capture the inter-class correlations since its break the multi-class correlation into independent binary problems.

The goal of Structured SVM is to

\section{Application to Information Retrieval and Computer Vision}

Structural SVM have been widely applied to Computer Vision 

\section{Structured SVM for MultiClassification}

We applied the Structured SVM classification to the usual task, obtaining the following loss curves :
