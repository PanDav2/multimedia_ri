\section{Introduction}

During our work, we have been taught how to implement Kernel-based Vector Machines for different tasks including : Multi-class classification, hierarchical classification. All of those . In this paper we are going to introduces Structured Support Vector Machines and our work regarding the various implementations.

\section{Kernel-based Vector Machines}

The Kernel-based Vector Machines \cite{} exposes

All throughout this course, we have been evolving from text information retrieval passing by graph.
We thus implemented the though the given
